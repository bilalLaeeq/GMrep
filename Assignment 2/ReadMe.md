1. Dodger

Description: Several bad guys fall from the top of the screen, and the user must avoid them. The player can be controlled with the arrow keys or more directly with the
 mouse. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score.

Variations: Have enemies fall at different rates and be different sizes. Have enemies fall from more than one side of the game. Have power up pickups that 
grant invulnerability for a while, slow down bad guys, give the player a temporary "reverse bad guys" power, etc.

2. Memory Puzzle

Description: A board full of overturned cards. There is a pair for each card. The player flips over two cards. If they match, then they stay overturned. 
Otherwise they flip back. The player needs to overturn all the cards in the fewest moves to win.

Variations: Provide "hints" in the form of four possible matching cards after the player flips the first one. Or, 
quickly overturn groups of cards at the beginning of the game

3. Sliding Puzzle
Description: A 4x4 board of numbered tiles has one missing space and is randomly set up. To win the game, the player must slide tiles over to put the tiles back 
in order.

Variants: Instead of numbers, you can have a scrambled picture cut up into 4x4 tiles.

4. Simon
Description: Four colored buttons light up in a specific pattern. After displaying the pattern, the player must repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in 
proper order. The pattern gets longer each time the player completes the pattern. If the player presses a wrong button, the game ends.

Variant: A nine-button version can add challenge to this game (but more than that would probably just be tedious.)
5. Connect Four

Description: Two players of different colors drop their tokens on an upright board. The player to make four tokens in a row, column, or diagonal wins. Creating an AI for this requires a simple minimax algorithm.

Variant: Different board sizes. Walls inside the board that appear when the spaces beneath them are filled.
