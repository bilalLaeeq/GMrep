 mouse. The longer the player lasts without being hit, the higher the score.

Variations: Have enemies fall at different rates and be different sizes. Have enemies fall from more than one side of the game. Have power up pickups that 
grant invulnerability for a while, slow down bad guys, give the player a temporary "reverse bad guys" power, etc.

2. Memory Puzzle
