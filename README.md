2. Muhammad Ahsan:     
My Idea: Get to know your ballon

Give each student an empty balloon and a slip of paper. Ask them to write a get-to-know-you question on their paper, such as How many brothers and sisters do you have? Do you have any pets? What’s one fun thing you did this summer? Next, have them put their question inside the balloon, blow it up, and tie the end.

When everyone is ready, have them gather on the rug, and, on your signal, toss their balloon up in the air. Give them a couple of minutes to bat the balloons around, then call stop. Have each student grab one balloon and come sit in a circle. Go around the circle and, one at a time, have students pop their balloon, read the question inside, and answer the question.

   "It's true that video games can improve many things like, problem-solving skills, Memorizing vocabulary and etc and best for Brain         refreshning, so if i talk about myself as a game developer, I'll create a story based game for example: that game will include some       action fight tournament, memorizing vocabulary and some sort of racing games and for girls there must be some stages of cooking foods     and cleaning room strategy so its basically a game with many stories and for multiplayers game."
